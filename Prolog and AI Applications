Prolog & Artificial Intelligence Applications

The features described above make Prolog suitable for developing applications that solve AI Problems. 
Such an area is that of Decision Support Systems. Rules that support decisions can be expressed as Prolog rules, 
declaratively in pure logic, making development and maintenance of these systems mush easier.

Except from financial decisions, medical decisions can be supported by similar systems written in Prolog. 
Decision support systems can also take the form of a computer based advisor. Another major AI area that 
Prolog contributes is that of Natural Language Processing. Pattern matching capabilities and the declarative 
nature of grammar definitions, make Prolog a handy and powerful tool for processing natural language.

Among the various AI applications using Prolog, many Knowledge-based Systems can be found. This is because, 
in most of the cases, knowledge in such systems is expressed in the form of rules. These rules can be easily 
expressed in Prolog syntax. After that, by using unification and Prolog search mechanism, inference can be done.

It is a fact that every AI problem that can be represented using graphs can be handled by Prolog search and
backtracking mechanism. Having such an advantage, various Prolog systems have been developed to solve 
Graph Theory Problems. Another AI area where Prolog is used is that of Scheduling and Planning. 
The “Generate & Test” technique and the pattern matching mechanism of Prolog, make the test of 
candidate generated solutions a much simpler task. The unification and pattern matching mechanism 
of Prolog can also be found useful for AI problems of Computer Vision.
