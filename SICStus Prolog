Feature Highlights

SICStus Prolog provides the means to integrate a very powerful Prolog engine in advanced, 
portable computing applications. It is the ideal choice for applications that require reasoning, 
search or pattern matching capabilities (e.g. intelligent web, rule engine, natural or formal language, 
and expert system style applications).

SICStus Prolog provides tools for delivering stand-alone applications as well as modules that 
can be linked with code written in other languages to create reliable solutions with Prolog embedded.

The latest version is 4.7.1
