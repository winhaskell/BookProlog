Why Learning Prolog Can Make You a Better Programmer

In Computer Science programs, there is a tradition of having a course of two that represent the watershed between people 
that can grok CS concepts and the ones that canâ€™t. Although anyone can do some programming in a language like Java, 
where anecdotal evidence seems to show that the most complicated concept is class, it takes real intelligence to do something useful in C or Lisp.

At my Alma mater, a course in Prolog was the division line between the hopeful and the real CS guys. The reasoning being that 
if you could get your head around a Prolog interpreter written in Prolog, then you can probably handle any programming concept.

These days however, CS programs are more interested in teaching marketable languages such as Java, Python, or Ruby. 
It seems like that they are looking for ways of getting people through the program as quick as possible (maybe before they realize where they are really going into).
