Since 2002 I am a permanent researcher (CR) in the Lifeware (formerly Contraintes) group of Inria Saclay-Île-de-France (formerly Paris-Rocquencourt).

My research interests focus around Computational Biology and Theoretical Computer Science. 
In this context I’m one of the main developers and maintainers of the BIOCHAM platform. 
This is where most of the techniques I develop, using Constraint Programming, Model-Checking, 
and other formal methods get implemented.
