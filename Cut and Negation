! pronounced “cut” is a special goal in prolog which always succeeds. 
The purpose of cut, loosely speaking, is to freeze some of the choices made by the backtracking sytem so far. 

Cuts can therefore be used to increase the efficiency (time) of prolog programs. 
First we will see how the backtracking is affected by the use of cuts. 
Then we will give an example use of cuts to speed up prolog programs. 
We will use cuts to define a negation operator (neg) in prolog. 
Finally, we rewrite the 8-queens program using the neg operator.
