Tips on Writing Prolog Programs
-------------------------------

To write a Prolog program:

1.
Have a clear intended interpretation: what all predicates, functions and constants mean

2.
Donâ€™t tell lies.
(a) Make sure all clauses are true given your meaning for the constants, functions, predicates.
(b) Make sure that the clauses cover all of the cases when a predicate is true.

3.
Avoid cycles. For example, be careful of predicates like path_between, 
which may end up with path_between(X, Y) :- path_between(Y, X).

4.
To solve a complex problem break it into simpler problems.
(a) Design top-down: Figure out the top-level predicates that you need. 
    Write out their meanings and high-level notes on how they will work. Break them down in terms of simpler predicates.
(b) Build bottom-up: Create, test, and debug the simplest predicates first. 
    Then, build more complex ones on top of them.
